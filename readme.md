# MyBB Tags Plus

An open source plugin for MyBB 1.8 that enables users to add moderator-defined tags to threads. This plugin is not to be confused with [ATofighi/MyBB-Tags](https://github.com/ATofighi/MyBB-Tags), though some ideas have been borrowed.

**Requires MySQLi** - support for other database systems coming later.
